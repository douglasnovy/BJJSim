# Milestones and Exit Criteria

- M1: Physics prototype renders two humanoids; contacts accessible; simple GUI overlays for contacts (Phase 1 exit)
- M2: Env step/reset returns typed observations; reward components logged; event annotations visible in GUI (Phase 2 exit)
- M3: PPO self-play trains for 100 iterations; no NaNs; rewards monotonic-ish (Phase 3 exit)
- M4: In evaluation, agent maintains top position (Δz > threshold) for ≥5 consecutive seconds in ≥50% of episodes; overlays confirm events; thresholds validated (Phase 4 exit)
