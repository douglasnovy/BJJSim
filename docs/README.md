# BJJSim Documentation

This folder is the canonical source of truth for requirements, architecture, and planning. Start with `requirements/overview.md` and proceed to architecture and planning as needed.

Structure

- `requirements/`: What the system must do and constraints
- `architecture/`: How we will design and implement it
- `planning/`: Roadmap, milestones, risks, and decisions (ADRs)
